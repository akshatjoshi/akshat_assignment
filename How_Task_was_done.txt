akshat_assignment script Version:1.0 17/01/2013

IIn my earlier and current oraganization i have write some script which gives menu option and ask from the script user to enter there desired operation and then it performed the 
requested task.So menu option i have coded earlier and have expirenced in it.

As well as most of the objective in the assignment i have coded earlier too as i have write some script which checks the health check of the production servers and also
state the status of the server health,opened port,load avg,process states etc.Due to that i have successfully coded the given assignment.

While completing this task i have take little help from man pages of the linux ,as well as light googling and my earlier coded script as well.
